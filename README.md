# konto.bratislava.sk

This project is led by the [Department of Innovation and Technology of the City of Bratislava](https://inovacie.bratislava.sk). We’re making it entirely open-source as we believe this promotes [savings, collaboration, auditability and innovation](https://publiccode.eu) in the public sector.

Our goal is to be transparent about services we’re developing and providing, as well as to invite other cities and municipalities to build on top of the same or similar open-source technologies we’ve already tested and used - to foster an ecosystem of collaboration between teams facing similar challenges. We’ll be happy to [get in touch.](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk)

> If you are an individual or a company who’d like to take part in these efforts, collaborate closely on development or report an issue, we’d love to hear from you! 🙌 Contact us using this repository or at [innovationteam@bratislava.sk](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk)

## What's here

Each sub-project contains README which should get you up and running. More documentation can be (eventually) found [here](https://bratislava.github.io)

🏡 `/next` Next.js web app

👀 `tests/cypress` Automated cypress tests

🗄️ `/strapi` Strapi CMS server

🗄️ `/nest-forms-backend` Service which is handling incoming and outcoming forms created by users

🐳 `docker-compose.yml` - if you need to quickly setup postgres or meilisearch instance, run `docker compose up postgres`. You need docker installed

## Development
In this section, you will find instructions for development.

### Deployment
You can easily deploy the whole project to clusters by creating tag `dev`, `staging` or `prod` plus version, like `prod1.0.0`. This will first deploy the backend apps, and at the end the frontend.
If you wish to deploy only a specific project, you can use a tag like `dev-next` or `dev-nest-forms-backend`, i.e. `div-nest-forms-backend1.0.0`. This will work for `staging` and `prod` as well.

### Validation and build pipelines
By creating a PR, GitHub actions will run validation pipelines and build pipeliness with `bratiska-cli`.
