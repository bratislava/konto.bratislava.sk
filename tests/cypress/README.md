## Run Cypress locally

To run cypress tests locally you need to run one of the following commands.
Currently tests are running against http://localhost:3000, so the app needs to be running.

```
npm run cypress:open //for open mode (Running tests in chrome browser)
```

```
npm run cypress:run // for terminal mode
```
