/**
 * This is the most important setting for RJSF, make sure to pass it to all RJSF components / functions. Anytime user
 * open a form, to display proper fields the data are prefilled by the library.
 *
 * `arrayMinItems` strategy:
 *
 * Let's break it down for each field type (defined in /generator/functions.ts):
 *  - `arrayField` - this is the only field that we want to get populated with default data if it is required - e.g.
 *    when user opens a form that contains list of "Tax records" and at least one is required, we want to display empty
 *    "Tax record" (which is an object with another fields) initially for user not to click on "+ Add tax record" button
 *    unnecessarily.
 *  - `selectMultiple` & `checkboxGroup` - these fields would get prefilled with `requiredOnly` strategy, but RJSF
 *    implements a special `isMultiSelect` check that flags those to not prefill.
 *    https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/blob/294b9e3d37c96888a0e8bb3c68a5b2b1afd452bf/packages/utils/src/schema/getDefaultFormState.ts#L403
 *  - `fileUpload` with `multiple: true` - these fields would get prefilled with `requiredOnly` strategy and RJSF doesn't
 *    handle this case, therefore custom `computeSkipPopulate` is needed, in case this is not present, RJSF prefills it
 *    as `[null]` which is not correct and causes bugs.
 *    This needed to be implemented for this use case: https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/pull/4121
 *
 * Why other strategies are not suitable:
 *  - `populate: 'always'` - this would prefill even not required `arrayField` fields
 *  - `populate: 'never'` - this would prefill nothing
 *
 * If a new field type is added to the generator, this needs to be reflected here. See tests for expected behavior.
 *
 * `allOf` strategy:
 *
 * This was a bug in RJSF:
 * https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/issues/3892
 * https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/issues/3832
 *
 * This should be a default behavior, but the maintainers decided to keep it as an experimental feature as it would be
 * a breaking change.
